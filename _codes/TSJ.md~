title: "Aiyagari Model with Non-homothetic CES Preferences in Three Sectors: Steady State and Transition"
collection: codes
permalink: /codes/NhCES
excerpt: "How to robustly solve for the steady state and transition paths of an Aiyagari model in continuous-time with non-homothetic CES preferences (as in Lashkari-et-al (2021)) and three sectors? The Matlab code below proposes an algorithm based on a predefined approximation of the marginal utility of expenditure using the so-called Chebyshev technology. Transition path in response to one or several series of MIT shocks can be efficiently solved for using a first-order perturbation of the marginal utility function approximation, along the transition path. The implementation below uses the excellent Chebfun package for Matlab, but a similar implementation is available in Julia upon request."
