title: "Two Endogenous State Variables in Continuous-Time: Wealth and Human Capital"
collection: codes
permalink: /codes/human_capital
excerpt: "This note describes a deterministic human capital accumulation problem in continuous time with one financial asset, and offers a solution algorithm using the finite-difference method. Agents can accumulate financial assets and human capital by dividing their time between labor and education. Human capital is accumulated via a DRS production function and depreciates over time. Labor income receives a wage per unit of time worked and per unit of human capital."
