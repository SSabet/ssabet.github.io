excerpt: "This note describes a deterministic human capital accumulation problem with one asset in continuous time. Agents can accumulate financial assets and human capital by dividing their time between labor and education. Human capital is accumulated via a DRS production function and depreciates over time. Labor income receives a wage per unit of time worked and per unit of human capital."
