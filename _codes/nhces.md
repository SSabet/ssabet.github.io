excerpt: "How to robustly solve for the steady state and transition paths of an Aiyagari model in continuous-time with non-homothetic CES preferences (as in Lashkari-et-al (2021)) and three sectors? The Matlab code below proposes an algorithm based on a predefined approximation of the (indirect) marginal utility of expenditure, using the so-called Chebyshev technology. Transition path in response to one or several series of MIT shocks can be efficiently solved using a first-order perturbation of the same marginal utility function along the transition path. The implementation below uses the excellent Chebfun package for Matlab, but a similar code is available (upon request) in Julia."
