I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the [London School of Economics and Political Science](https://www.lse.ac.uk/economics), doing research in Macroeconomics and its intersection with (household) finance and development. I am interested in studying sources of risk and constraints faced by the households in lower- and middle-income economies, and how those affect their consumption and investment behaviour. I use heterogeneous agent models to study how the aggregate behaviour affects, and is affected by, the state and process of development, as well as the policy implications.

I hold a BSc in Computer Science from Sharif University of Technology, and Masters in Decision Mathematics and Theoretical Economics from [Toulouse School of Economics](https://www.tse-fr.eu/).

I am on the 2025/26 job market, you can find my paper here.

<!-- How to edit your site's GitHub repository -->
<!-- ------ -->
<!-- Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and Markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.  -->
