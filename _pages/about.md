I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the [London School of Economics and Political Science](https://www.lse.ac.uk/economics), with research interests in Macroeconomics and its intersection with (household) finance and development. 

My research examines sources of risk and constraints faced by the households in lower- and middle-income economies, the effects on their consumption and investment behaviour and distribution of income and wealth, and implications for the level and pace of development of their economies. I use heterogeneous agent models to quantify how such risks and constraints affect, and are affected by, the state and process of development, and to study policy implications.

In addition, I have explored topics in computational economics, in particular, solution methods for solving multivariate DSGE problems, with a focus on continuous-time heterogeneous agent models.

I hold a BSc. in Computer Science from Sharif University of Technology, and Masters in Decision Mathematics (M1) and Econometrics and Theoretical Economics (M2) from [Toulouse School of Economics](https://www.tse-fr.eu/).
