At LSE, I have taught Macroeconomics at both the undergraduate (EC1B5, EC301) and graduate levels (EC413), Math Boot Camp for the incoming graduate students (EC400), and Foundations of Economics for the first year undergraduate students in Economics (EC102).

Few rewarding expressions from my latest teaching evaluation:  "*fantastic tutor who's enthusiasm for macroeconomics is as undeniable as it is infectious*", "*[he is] humble, patient, enlightened*", "*[he has] amazing presentation skills, ability to explain things clearly and a great sense of humor*", and "*amazing tutor, literally the best I have had!*" [Here](https://ssabet.github.io/files/04-EC413_AT24_Soroush_Sabet.pdf) you can find the full teaching evaluation file.

Visit the [Macro Notebooks](https://ssabet.github.io/notebooks/) page to check out the six Pluto notebooks I created while teaching (graduate) Macroeconomics in 2023, to help my students develop intuition for Macroeconomics models (which they found very useful).
